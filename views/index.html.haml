%h2.ribbon Where
%p
  Contestants may participate from anywhere in the world, but all
  code must be stored on
  != ' <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, '
  and contest entries must be deployed to
  != ' <a href="http://www.joyent.com/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=nodeknockout">Joyent</a> or'
  != ' <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>. '
  GitHub, Joyent, and Heroku will all be providing free services as sponsors
  during the competition.
%h2.ribbon Why
%p
  %a{ href: 'http://www.nodejs.org' } node.js
  isn&rsquo;t just another MVC web framework.
  It&rsquo;s at the bleeding edge of a technology stack that allows developers
  to blur the lines between software, the web, and the new like never before.
%p
  Whatever the contest winners are, we suspect
  %a{ href: 'http://githubissues.heroku.com/' } they
  %a{ href: 'http://mnutt.github.com/hummingbird/' } won&rsquo;t
  %a{ href: 'http://wargamez.mape.me/' } look
  %a{ href: 'http://www.lazeroids.com/' } like
  traditional websites.
%h2.ribbon How can I help?
%p
  For now, spread the word.
