%h2.ribbon Rules

%h3 Node.js
%p
  All applications must be built using node.js. No substitutes! (Are there
  substitutes?) This isn't to say you can't use additional technology to
  supplement node.js, like Amazon S3 or MongoDB or a biofuel-powered lawnmower
  running off of leftover Thai food. Thai food is tasty.

%h3 48 Hours
%p
  You've got exactly 48 hours to develop your web app during the Knockout, not
  a minute more. The competition kicks off at 12:00am / 00:00 GMT on August 28,
  2010 and will end at 12:00am / 00:00 GMT on August 30, 2010. Of course, feel
  free to work on the concept for your application before the competition
  starts: pretty hand-drawn pictures on napkins, angry email threads between
  team members on two-space or four-space indentation, schema designs, finite
  state machines. Just no digital assets including graphic design assets, code,
  etc.
%p
  After those 48 hours are up, an expert panel and the public will be invited
  to use your application and judge it against the competition. No additional
  features or bugfixes are allowed during this period, or you will be
  disqualified. Don't make us disqualify you; it will make us sad.

%h3 Teams and Contestants
%p
  Teams should be comprised of between one and four individuals. No more than
  four people are allowed on a team (and no less than one). To be eligible,
  teams must register at least 1 week prior to the start of the competition
  (space subject to availability).
%p
  Don't worry if you work for a sponsor: they won't be able to influence the
  judging process.  Moreover, don't worry if you know a judge either: we'll
  prevent judges from voting on a team they know personally and they're
  committed to stay impartial.

%h3 Source Control
%p
  Source code will be hosted in a shiny, free git repository provided by
  != ' <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. '
  Your team should push regularly to show progress. We'll be watching to make
  sure people don't cheat (don't think you can develop everything ahead of time
  and push it all at the end; we know lots of git tricks too). We'll send
  GitHub access information before the competition starts, so make sure you've
  signed up for a free GitHub account and provided us with your GitHub
  username.

%h3 Deployment
%p
  %a{ href: 'http://www.joyent.com' } Joyent
  and
  %a{ href: 'http://heroku.com' } Heroku
  will provide free, private instances to deploy your code to. Which one you
  choose is up to you (kinda like Pok√©mon): Heroku is crazy fast and easy to
  get started with, but has some limitations (non-writable disk; 30 second
  request/response timeout); Joyent provides a full VPS, so you will be able to
  set the machine up however you want, but also note that Joyent only provides
  Solaris (ZFS!). Expect access information before the competition starts. You
  cannot deploy to your own server, no matter how awesome it is.
%p
  Entries will remain up until winners are announced. During judging, we will
  need access via an SSH key to make sure there is no cheating, including
  comparing deployed code with that in the git repo. After the 48-hour
  deadline, you will still be allowed to restart processes, free up disk space,
  and other general sysadmin tasks, including playing lots of StarCraft 2.

%h3 Web Application
%p
  Entries should be web applications. It's hard for judges (especially
  the general public) to fairly evaluate entries that require compilation or
  setup. If you want to submit a non-web app, you're welcome to, but you aren't
  likely to get judged fairly. If an app is not a website, but some library,
  utility, or desktop program, then it must be deployed to the
  %a{ href: 'http://npmjs.org' } npm
  registry.
%p
  If you do decide to submit something that isn't immediately accessible
  via the web, then we encourage you to think of a clever way to share it as a
  website, for example via
  != ' <a href="http://guacamole.sourceforge.net/">VNC</a>.'

%h3 Libraries
%p
  Libraries, plugins, and modules that are public and freely available are
  allowed and encouraged. Please list all libraries that you use on your team's
  profile page to give credit where it's due. Stock photos and free icon sets
  are allowed. Paying for something that is not generally available to everyone
  is not allowed, and not nice.
%p
  Developing a library in secret before the competition that provides the same
  general functionality of your project will likely get you disqualified. On
  the other hand, developing a library that is publicly available and provides
  a general-purpose, publicly usable function can be done before the
  competition begins.

%h3 Web Services
%p
  We encourage use of third-party web services and their APIs (e.g. Twitter,
  Flickr, Google maps, Yahoo! pipes, OpenID). Almost everyone loves mashups.
  Again, make sure to update your team profile with what services you use.

%h3 Ownership and Open Source
%p
  The code you write is yours. If you intend to share it after the competition,
  you can pick whatever license you love. We encourage contestants to open
  source their code, but it's totally up to you. If you want to start a
  business based on it, awesome.
%p
  Note however, we will have access to your GitHub repository during the
  competition to audit for cheating, but we won't steal any of your secret
  recipes or patent pending algorithms. Stealing will get us disqualified.

%h3 Judging
%p
  Winners will be picked by judge voting. Judging duties will be split 50/50
  between a
  %a{ href: '/judging' } group of industry experts
  and the general public. More details will be
  posted to the
  %a{ href: '/judging' } judging page
  soon.

%h3 Miscellany
%p
  Don't break any laws. Don't harm any animals (especially
  != ' <a href="http://www.sibfox.com">domesticated foxes</a>). '
  Also, you might want to read through the
  %a{ href: '/faq' } FAQ
  for some specific, more nuanced issues.
